JavaScript School by DataArt(2025) - Homework

## Stage 1 - Static Skeleton

This is the initial stage of the Timeline App project.

### Features Included:
- A semantic HTML structure with:
  - `<header>` containing logo and theme toggle button
  - `<nav>` for future filters
  - `<main>` with a `<section id="timeline">` to hold timeline events
  - `<div id="modal">` for future modal pop-ups
- Clean and semantic tag usage with placeholder elements for upcoming features.

This static setup lays the foundation for building an interactive and styled timeline experience in the next stages.
